## Ailie's Story
Ailie is the founder of SurfaBabe. She grew up in Hawaii surfing and loving the ocean. During the pandemic, her family sold everything and lived on a boat, sailing through the Caribbean, Colombia, and Panama. The big moment came when she got terrible chemical burns from a store-bought laundry detergent — unable to sleep for days, weeks to heal. That's when she decided to make her own Natural Laundry Soap, and SurfaBabe was born. The family then moved to Vietnam, where Ailie finished high school early at age 16. They made their own natural sunscreen for a school project and were surprised when it worked better than store-bought ones, even during long surf sessions.
