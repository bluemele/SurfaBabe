## Products

### What is tallow?
Tallow is rendered beef fat from grass-fed cattle. It's been used for centuries in skincare. It's rich in vitamins A, D, E, K and fatty acids that closely match human skin's natural oils.

### Is tallow vegan?
No. Tallow is an animal-derived ingredient. Our Cocoa Butter Mineral Sunscreen (product #4) is the plant-based alternative.

### Are your products safe for sensitive skin?
Yes! Our unscented products are formulated for sensitive skin. We always recommend a patch test before first use, especially for the tallow cream.

### Do your sunscreens have SPF ratings?
Our sunscreens use non-nano zinc oxide which provides broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection. They are mineral/physical sunscreens (not chemical). Reapply every 2 hours in direct sun.

### Are your sunscreens reef-safe?
Yes! Both sunscreens use non-nano zinc oxide and are reef-safe.

### Does the surface cleaner kill germs?
Our surface cleaners are effective cleaners but they do NOT disinfect or sanitize. They remove dirt, grease, and grime naturally.

### How long does the laundry detergent last?
The 1kg bag is concentrated — you use less per load than conventional detergent. Typically lasts 40-60 loads depending on load size and soil level.
