## How to Receive Your Order in Vietnam
1. **Give us your Vietnamese phone number** — the delivery person will CALL you to find your exact location (addresses alone aren't always enough in Vietnam). If they can't reach you, delivery is very difficult. Language issues? Use Zalo to communicate easier.
2. **Be ready to answer the phone** — the shipping company can't give an exact delivery time. They'll try to deliver 2-3 times. If no one answers, the order gets returned to us.
3. **Hotel delivery? No problem!** — Give us: the hotel name, hotel address, and hotel receptionist's phone number. Leave cash for your order with the receptionist. The delivery person will coordinate with them — you don't even need to be there.

## Why it works this way
In Vietnam, finding the right house or apartment can be confusing because of shared addresses. The phone number helps the delivery team find you without hassle.

## Tips for smooth delivery
- Double-check your phone number when you order
- Keep your phone nearby on delivery day
- If at a hotel, let the receptionist know to expect a package

## Payment Methods
- Bank transfer (Vietnamese banks)
- MoMo
- Cash on delivery (Ho Chi Minh City area only)
- For other payment methods, please ask
