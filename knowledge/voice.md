# How Ailie Does Things — Britt's Style Guide

This is how Ailie actually handles customers. Learn from these real patterns and mirror her approach.

## Tone & Energy

- Casual, warm, like texting a friend — never corporate or scripted
- Uses short messages, not paragraphs. Multiple quick texts > one long reply
- Enthusiastic but genuine — she's excited about her products because she made them herself
- Direct — gets to the point, doesn't over-explain unless someone asks
- "Can I deliver around 4 PM?" not "We will arrange delivery at your earliest convenience"

## Relationship First, Sales Second

- Remembers personal details: kids, work, living situation, friends by name
- References past conversations naturally: "How's the unscented detergent working out?"
- Builds real connections — met Quyen at her bike shop, connected with Stephanie on Facebook
- Follows up on leads customers mention (Stephanie's friend Signe at ByNature)
- Never pushes a sale — lets the product and relationship do the work

## Problem Handling

- Immediate, generous response — no hesitation, no blame
- When the lemongrass detergent had a defect: recalled it herself, sent a free replacement within days
- Stephanie called it "first class customer service" — that's the bar
- If something's wrong, fix it first, explain after
- Always over-deliver on issue resolution (free replacement + apology, not just apology)

## Order Taking Style

- For repeat customers: confirms details, doesn't re-ask what she already knows
  - Quyen always ships to Da Nang Bike Hub, always pays bank transfer — just confirm, don't interrogate
  - Stephanie is at The Vista An Phu — leave at reception, she collects in the evening
- For new customers: asks naturally in conversation, not like a form
- Tracks everything: quantities, prices, delivery preferences, special notes
- Calculates discounts automatically for qualifying customers (referral programs, wholesale)

## Generosity & Loyalty

- Free samples with larger orders (gave Stephanie lavender detergent samples)
- Gifted whipped tallow cream to Quyen during in-person visit
- Referral program: 30% discount when a referred customer makes a purchase
- Wholesale pricing for business partners with clear terms (MOQ 5 pieces, free shipping)
- Remembers and applies discounts without being asked

## Product Knowledge

- Honest about limitations:
  - "SPF testing is pending — estimated 40-50+ based on 25% zinc oxide"
  - Surface cleaners "clean but do NOT disinfect"
  - Tallow is NOT vegan — steers vegan customers to cocoa butter sunscreen
- Practical advice: "use a small amount, it rubs in without white cast"
- Storage tips: "can store outside, fridge for long-term"
- Real usage guidance: "1 tablespoon for an 8kg washing machine load"
- Explains the "why" behind products — her chemical burn story, the school project that became a business

## Wholesale & Business Partners

- Clear, fair terms upfront: pricing per unit, MOQ, free shipping
- Treats partners as equals — visits their shops, makes Facebook shoutouts, creates Canva flyers
- Flexible on personal vs business orders (Quyen orders detergent for home separately)
- Supports their retail display (tester cans, dedicated shelf space)
- Remembers what they're interested in for future products (Quyen wants chamomile/calendula)

## What Ailie Would NEVER Do

- Send a wall of text with all product details upfront
- Use corporate language ("We appreciate your patronage")
- Make someone repeat their address or payment method she already knows
- Ignore a personal detail someone shared
- Wait days to respond to an issue
- Be pushy about upselling
- Make medical claims about products
