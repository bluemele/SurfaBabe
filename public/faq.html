      <!-- Ailie's Story -->
      <div class="faq-story">
        <h2>Ailie's Story</h2>
        <p>Ailie is the founder of SurfaBabe. She grew up in Hawaii surfing and loving the ocean. During the pandemic, her family sold everything and lived on a boat, sailing through the Caribbean, Colombia, and Panama. The big moment came when she got terrible chemical burns from a store-bought laundry detergent — unable to sleep for days, weeks to heal. That's when she decided to make her own Natural Laundry Soap, and SurfaBabe was born. The family then moved to Vietnam, where Ailie finished high school early at age 16. They made their own natural sunscreen for a school project and were surprised when it worked better than store-bought ones, even during long surf sessions.</p>

      <div class="faq-panel" id="laundry">

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is SurfaBabe's All Natural Laundry Detergent?</summary>
          <p>It effectively cleans your clothes without any chemicals, fragrances, preservatives or other unnecessary and harmful additives. Up to 5 simple, safe, and biodegradable ingredients making it safe and effective for you, your family, and the planet.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Why doesn't the All Natural Laundry Detergent create bubbles? Is it still cleaning effectively?</summary>
          <p>Bubbles ≠ Cleaning Power. The idea that bubbles equal cleanliness is a common misconception. Bubbles are often just for show. Our soap contains only four powerful, concentrated ingredients: baking soda, washing soda, Epsom salt, and sea salt. Each plays a crucial role in cleaning. Many conventional detergents add chemical foaming agents just to create bubbles.</p>

      <div class="faq-panel" id="tallow">

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is Whipped Tallow Cream, and how does it benefit my skin?</summary>
          <p>A natural non-greasy moisturizer made with just two ingredients: Grass-Fed Tallow and Jojoba Oil. Tallow is a timeless skincare secret — it mimics your skin's oils to deeply nourish and repair the skin barrier. Rich in vitamins A, D, E, and K, it supports healing, reduces inflammation, and promotes a youthful glow. Its anti-bacterial properties soothe acne, rashes, and irritation.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is this suitable for sensitive skin or acne-prone skin?</summary>
          <p>Yes. The grass-fed tallow and jojoba oil are non-comedogenic (won't clog pores), and their anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties help soothe irritation and reduce acne. Always patch test first if you're new to Tallow or have sensitive skin.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">

        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How do I use the Whipped Tallow Cream?</summary>
          <p>Apply a small amount to clean, dry skin on your face or body. Gently massage until absorbed. Use daily or as needed for moisturizing, healing, or soothing skin concerns like dryness, rashes, or wrinkles. A little goes a long way due to its rich, creamy texture.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I use this on my baby or children?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Its two natural ingredients are gentle and free of chemicals, artificial fragrances, or preservatives, making it ideal for delicate skin. Always patch-test first.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How long does the 30ml jar last?</summary>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can it be used for specific skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis?</summary>
          <p>Many customers report relief from eczema, psoriasis, and other skin conditions due to the cream's anti-inflammatory and healing properties. However, consult a dermatologist for severe conditions, and always patch-test first.</p>
        </details>

      <!-- Surface Cleaner Panel -->
      <div class="faq-panel" id="cleaner">

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is SurfaBabe's Surface Cleaner?</summary>

        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What surfaces can I safely clean with this product?</summary>
          <p>Sealed stone (e.g., kitchen countertops), ceramic tiles (floors, walls), stainless steel (sinks, appliances), sealed wood (furniture, floors), and glass (when sprayed lightly and wiped gently). Avoid scrubbing undissolved powder on glass to prevent scratches or streaks.</p>
        </details>

          <p>For light cleaning: mix 1-2 tsp per liter of warm water in a spray bottle. For heavy cleaning (e.g., mopping): use 1 TBSP per liter. Dissolve fully, shake well, and apply. Wipe with a clean cloth or mop.</p>

        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How should I store the Surface Cleaner?</summary>
          <p>Store the powder in its sealed container in a cool, dry place to maintain potency and prevent clumping. Avoid exposure to moisture until ready to mix.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Does it disinfect?</summary>
